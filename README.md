Time Series Demo for FCC Fedex Day (March 11-12, 2013)
=======

<h2>Goals:</h2>

- explore the capabilities of the JS charting/graphing libraries HighStock and Rickshaw
- implement a publicly available API that provides stock data or other times series data
- investigate other time series libraries (time permitting)

These demos were created while exploring the capabilities of the JS charting/graphing libraries HighStock and Rickshaw.

Criteria for choosing a library:

- Is it open source (or at least free to try)?
- Does the library have good documentation, community support, and currently maintained?
- What are the ‘out of the box’ features?
- How easy is it to learn and customize?


The following libraries and API's were used to create the pages:

- jQuery v1.8.3
- Bootstrap v2.3.1
- HighStock v1.2.5 
- Markit On Demand - Company Lookup API
- Markit On Demand - Stock Quote API

All of the demos display a chart of historical data based on an entered stock symbol and number of days.
