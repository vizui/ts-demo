Time Series Demo

These demos were created while exploring the capabilities of the JS charting/graphing libraries HighStock and Rickshaw.

The following libraries and API's were used to create the pages:

- jQuery v1.8.3
- Bootstrap v2.3.1
- HighStock v1.2.5 
- Markit On Demand - Company Lookup API
- Markit On Demand - Stock Quote API

All of the demos display a chart of historical data based on an entered stock symbol and number of days.

<b>rs-line.html</b> - uses Ricksaw<br>
<b>hs-compare-multi.html</b> - uses HighStock<br>
<b>hs-compare-multi-co.html</b> - uses HighStock
